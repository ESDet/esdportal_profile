Feature: Edit a school profile as School Leader
        As a School Leader with a School Profile node f=or which I have write access permissions
        In order to manage my school's profile
        I want to edit the profile

# IMHO, this shouldn't be a feature, but an assertion of the test
#Feature: Disallow editing some fields on School Profile from School Leader
#          As a School Leader with a School Profile node for which I have write access permissions
#            In order to manage my school's profile but not mess up the database
#              I should not be able to edit 'field_school'
